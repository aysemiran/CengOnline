# CengOnline

## Course Management Application with Android Studio 

#### Scope of the Project


It is expected to create a course management system in this project. In this system, which has 2
types of user types, students will have the authority to follow the information related to their
courses, to see assignments and announcements, to upload assignments, to follow posts in the
stream, to comment a post in the stream and send or receive messages. Teachers will have the
authority to follow progress related to their courses, view, add, edit and delete assignments and
announcements, view assignments uploaded by the student, follow posts in the stream, add new
posts to the stream, edit and delete posts, to comment a post in the stream and send or receive
messages.
